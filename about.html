      <h1>About the Developer</h1>
       <p>Hello, my name is Hannah Zeng. I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
      Mathematics at CUNY Queens College. I am interested in software development and Android
      development. A little fun fact about me is that my first name is a palindrome. ^V^ Of
      course this is not the reason why I choose it as my English name. My Chinese name is
      Huiqing with my father's expectation of wisdom, beauty, and honesty for me. </p>
